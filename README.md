Basic Operators
===============================================
Within the `basic-operators.js` file are four empty methods. To pass the tests you must complete the methods i.e write their implementations.

The methods are defined below:

###sumOfNaturalNumbers(n)
This takes an integer n and computes the sum of natural numbers all up to that integer.

###modulusAndSum(a, b)
This method computes the modulus of `a` and `b` and adds the result to `a`.

###logicalAnd(a, b, c)
This method takes three integers and returns a boolean that states if `c` falls between `a` and `b`.

###charAtHalfLength(string)
This method takes a string as its sole argument and returns a string containing the character in the middle of the string.


### How to Run this Lab

+ Clone the repository
+ Open **index.html** in your browser to see the currently failing test specs you are to pass
+ Open the repository in your favorite text editor to explore the different files
+ Open **js\basic-operators.js** and write the function(s) or lines of code to pass the tests
+ You could refresh **index.html** in your browser intermittently to see the status of test specs.


###Notes


+ Prior understanding of Javascript classes, returning, and conditional statements will be required to complete this exercise.

+ Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make
it.

+ Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the specification.

Have fun!
