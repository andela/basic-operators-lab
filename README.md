Operators
===============================================
There are a few methods to test your knowledge of Javascript's mathematical operators and comparators.


`sumOfNaturalNumbers(10) === 55 // "true"`

`modulusAndSum(7, 5) === 9 // "true"`

`logicalAnd(10, 11, 3) === true // "true"`

`charAtHalfLength("Food") === 'o' // "true"`


The four methods have been defined for you in the `basic-operators.js` file. You must supply the implementations for each method to pass the tests for that method.

Also, in order to pass all of the tests, you have to write your return statements in one line of code.
